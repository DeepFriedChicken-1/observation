# ü™ê Planetary Nebula Morphology Analyzer

This project aims to analyze the structure of planetary nebulae (PN) using publicly available astronomical data. It focuses on **automatically classifying nebulae based on morphology**, as well as **comparing how their appearance changes across different wavelengths**. The results will be presented in forms suitable for **scientific research, outreach, or education**.

## üåå Project Goals

1. **Automatic Morphological Classification**
   - Develop code to identify and categorize planetary nebulae based on visible structural features.
   - Classification may include types such as spherical, elliptical, bipolar, or irregular.
   - Approaches may include statistical shape analysis, rule-based logic, or machine learning.

2. **Multi-Wavelength Morphological Comparison**
   - Retrieve images of the same planetary nebula across various electromagnetic bands (optical, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.).
   - Analyze and visualize how morphology differs depending on wavelength.
   - Use this analysis to infer physical characteristics such as dust content, ionization structure, and central star activity.

3. **Presentable, Accessible Results**
   - Output results in clear, interpretable formats: annotated visuals, comparison charts, and summarized metrics.
   - Make tools and visuals suitable for research exploration or educational presentation.
   - Allow for case studies on individual nebulae as well as broader morphological trends.

## üìä Example Research Questions

- Can we reliably classify planetary nebulae from public survey imagery alone?
- How does the observed morphology of bipolar nebulae differ between optical and infrared bands?
- Are certain morphological types more common in specific galactic regions or environments?
- What physical clues do asymmetries or halos provide about progenitor star systems?
